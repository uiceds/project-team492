## 3. Exploratory Data Analysis {.page_break_before}
   
__3.1 Preliminary Analysis and Plots__ 
<p style="text-align:justify;">
To understand our selected dataset, we did some preliminary analysis to visualize the dataset which enabled us to learn some of the patterns of different land use features with NO2 concentration. First, we tried find out if there is any direct relationship between any of the land use characteristics and NO2 concentrations measured at the monitor station. For this preliminary analysis, we considered the effect of this land use pattern within 100m, 5000m and 10000m radius of the station. The reason for selecting these three radii was to cover short, medium and long-distance land use behavior around the station. Figure 3.1-3.5 presents the effect of different land-use characteristics on the NO2 concentration. 
</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">
For impervious surfaces, for all three cases, we can clearly see there is a trend that with the increase of impervious surfaces around the station, the concentration of NO2 increases gradually (Figure 3.1). As the impervious surface increases, it indicates there is increase in roads, sidewalks, parking lots, buildings, traffic and also there is decrease in vegetation areas and soil surface. Therefore, all these impervious surfaces are kind of indicator of high volume of vehicles, high population density which contributes to high NO2 emission and also the absence of natural filtration effect with the absence of vegetation is another major source of NO2 emission.
</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">
In case of Major roads, we clearly see with the increasing length of major roads, there is clear increase in the concentration of NO2 (Figure 3.2). Moreover, visually, it looks like there is a steep increase in the concentration of NO2 initially with the increase of major roads, but the rate of increase slows down as the length of major roads increases further. The reason for such an increase is understandable since the production of NO2 is directly influenced by the volume of traffic, and high-traffic areas will release more NO2 as more diesel vehicles will be on the road, contributing to high NO2 emissions.

</figure>

<p style="text-align:justify;">
Similar trend is observed for the relationship between NO2 concentration and residential roads and total roads (Figure 3.3-3.4). In case of population, it looked like an exponential curve which might describe the pattern very well where initially with the increase in population there is a drastic increase in NO2 concentration which saturates at a certain point (Figure 3.5). Figure 3.6 shows the relationship between NO2 concentration and the distance from the coast. In general, as the distance from the coast will be less, there should be lower concentration of NO2 due to the ventilation from the winds. However, in the figure we can clearly see higher concentration of NO2 in some of the places which are closest to coast. It indicates that although coastal distance have effect on NO2 but it should be analyzed in combination with other land use pattern because even if the place is closer to coast but if there is high population density and roads, it will have higher NO2. 
Overall, all of these land-use characteristics have their own effect on the NO2 concentration and in some cases, there is strong relationship with NO2.

<p style="text-align:justify;">
As a next step, we also investigated the scenario of NO<sub>2</sub> concentration at individual state level and for the preliminary analysis we selected two states- IL, CA, FL and ND. The reason of selecting these four states was to capture the diverse representation of factors that might influence the NO<sub>2</sub> level which might be helpful for generalizing our analysis in future. CA is a highly urbanized and densely populated state with around 94 station available at the given dataset which is the reason we considered CA for our analysis. IL offers a perspective in the NO<sub>2</sub> pattern of Midwest’s urban and suburban areas whereas FL is a coastal state which might help to understand the effect of breeze and humidity on NO<sub>2</sub>. Lastly, ND is a low-population and rural environment with minimal urbanization which might help us to understand the effect of such characteristics on NO<sub>2</sub>. The effect of the land use characteristics described earlier on NO<sub>2</sub> concentrations are summarized in Figure 3.7-3.10.   
</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">
For CA state, visually we can clearly see there exists a correlation among impervious surface, population, length of the roads and NO2 concentration (Figure 3.7). Interesting to see, although some of the places are very closer to the coast but it has significant concentration of NO<sub>2</sub>. As discussed earlier, although the coastal distance is lower but other factors such as impervious area, population and length of the roads are so high that it affects the NO<sub>2</sub> significantly compared to the coastal distance from measuring station.

    <figcaption><strong>Figure 3.7:</strong> Effect of different land use characteristics on NO<sub>2</sub> concentration of CA state.</figcaption>
</figure>

<p style="text-align:justify;">
For IL state, there were only 6 stations, and the results suggests that there is a good relationship between impervious surface and NO<sub>2</sub> concentrations (Figure 3.8) . Also, since IL is far away from the coast it is clearly seen that NO<sub>2</sub> concentration has kind of linear relationship with coastal distance. Population and residential roads don’t reveal any clear pattern but with the major roads, it is clearly visible that increase in the length of major roads correlates well with the increase in NO<sub>2</sub> concentrations. 
</p>

    <figcaption><strong>Figure 3.8:</strong> Effect of different land use characteristics on NO<sub>2</sub> concentration of IL state.</figcaption>
</figure>

<p style="text-align:justify;">
For FL state, impervious surface, population, roads all these parameters have kind of steady linear relationship with NO2 concentration and with the increase in these parameters NO<sub>2</sub> increase is not that significant (Figure 3.9). For example, in IL state, some of the places with 70-80% impervious area has around 30 ppb NO<sub>2</sub> concentration whereas in FL, places with 60-80% impervious area has around 12 ppb NO<sub>2</sub>. One of the major reason of this observed lower values could be due to the fact that all the stations in FL area are very close to the coast showing the noticeable effect of it on NO<sub>2</sub>.

    <figcaption><strong>Figure 3.9:</strong> Effect of different land use characteristics on NO<sub>2</sub> concentration of FL state. </figcaption>
</figure>

<p style="text-align:justify;">
In case of ND state, although it is very far from the coast but still it has very low concentration of NO<sub>2</sub> (highest being ~6%) (Figure 3.10). It could be attributed to the fact that all the stations had very low population and the length of the roads are the lowest among all the four states considered in the preliminary analysis. Overall, it is seen that out of all the land use characteristic considered, all of the factors do not have similar effect on NO2 concentration, and the effect varies from state to state.

__3.2 Data selection and Feature Engineering__
<p style="text-align:justify;">
Based on the above plots, although we can see some correlation between few parameters but it is difficult to select the important feature to be considered for predictive modelling. Therefore, as a next step we tried correlation plots and Lasso regularization to find out the most relevant parameters for predictive modelling. Since there were numerous variables in the dataset, initially selective dependent variables at 100, 5000 and 1000m considered. Typical correlation plot of impervious_100, impervious_5000 and impervious_10000 are shown in Figure 3.11. Similarly, we explored all other variables and analyzed their correlation plots and finally selected the most important features based on this analysis for predictive modelling. The correlation plot of some of the final selected features are shown in Figure 3.12 and it is clear that these features exhibited lower inter correlations among themselves.

</figure>
<p style="text-align:justify;">
To aid this feature selection process with correlation plot, Lasso Regression (Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator) was applied to the dataset for selecting the most relevant features to predict observed NO2 concentrations. The main advantage of Lasso regression is that it reduces complexity by shrinking less important feature coefficient to zero. The reason of selecting Lasso was as it performs both feature selection and regularization, simplifying the model by irrelevant and redundant features. Lasso Regression along with cross-validation was applied that performs k-fold cross-validation (which is by default 10) to find the optimal regularization parameter, lambda. Alpha value of 1.0 specifies exactly Lasso regularization rather than Ridge or elastic net. Thereafter, using the best lambda value, a new Lasso model was fit which enable the model to learn the optimal coefficient for selected features. Finally, coefficient of features was evaluated and non-zero coefficients were calculated by Lasso for using the selected features for further modelling. (Table 3.1). It is seen that along with the features selected from correlation plot, Lasso regularization suggested few other independent variables which were also considered for modelling. To develop predictive model, for training and test data distribution, 75/25 ratio was followed where 75% of data points were considered training data and rest of the data points were test data.

__3.3 Plan for Predictive Modeling__ 
<p style="text-align:justify;">
Based on the preliminary analysis of our dataset, it is evident that all these land-use parameters, such as impervious surfaces, road density, population distribution, etc. play a crucial role in shaping NO₂ concentrations. These parameters exhibit a strong correlation with NO₂ levels, underscoring their significance as predictors. Building on these findings, we will develop a predictive regression model capable of estimating NO₂ concentrations across different states in the U.S., factoring in the varying land-use patterns with high accuracy. For developing this model, we will consider the independent variables as selected above from Lasso Regularization and correlation plots. Eventually, we will apply the model to predict NO<sub>2</sub> levels in regions that do not have measured data on NO<sub>2</sub> but have land-use information.
