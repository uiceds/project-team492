__Characterization of Dataset__ 

<p style="text-align:justify;">

The dataset we are going to use is obtained from Bechle et al. [1] which was used for estimating air pollution in terms of NO<sub>2</sub> from 2000 to 2010. The dataset contains spatial and temporal concentration of NO<sub>2</sub> in ppb at different locations of the different states in US. It also contains Geographic Information System (GIS) data on land-use features such as impervious surfaces, population density, length of different types of roads-residential, major and total etc. These are commonly used as proxies for different pollution sources [2-4]. Based on the dataset, NO<sub>2</sub> concentration varies significantly from state to state depending on different land-use pattern and the value range between 0.31~34.21 ppb for different states. The distribution of the NO<sub>2</sub> pollutants across the US based on location are shown in Figure 1. Some of the explanations of the dataset are provided below:
</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">
Impervious_100: This represents the percentage of impervious surfaces such as roads, buildings etc. within a 100-meter buffer around the measuring station.
Major_1000: It refers to the length of the major roads within a 1-kilometer radius around the measuring location.
Resident_500: This indicates length of the roads within 500-meter radius of the monitoring station.
Total_100: It represents the length of all the roads including major, minor and residential within a 100-meter buffer zone around the measuring station.
Population_100: It denotes the population density within the 100-meter buffer area around the measuring station.

__Preliminary Analysis and Plots__ 
<p style="text-align:justify;">
From the given dataset, we did some preliminary analysis to visualize the dataset and the summary of the observations are described briefly:
First, we tried to find out if there is any direct relationship between any of the land use characteristics and NO<sub>2</sub> concentrations measured at the monitor station. For this preliminary analysis, we considered the effect of this land use pattern within 100m, 5000m and 10000m radius of the station. The reason for selecting these three radii was to cover short, medium and long-distance land use behavior around the station. Figure 2-7 presents the effect of different land-use characteristic on the NO<sub>2</sub> concentration.
</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">
For impervious surfaces, for all three cases, we can clearly see there is a trend that with the increase of impervious surfaces around the station, the concentration of NO<sub>2</sub> increases gradually (Figure 2). As the impervious surface increases, it indicates there is increase in roads, sidewalks, parking lots, buildings, traffic and also there is decrease in vegetation areas and soil surface. Therefore, all these impervious surfaces are kind of indicator of high volume of vehicles, high population density which contributes to high NO<sub>2</sub> emission and also the absence of natural filtration effect with the absence of vegetation is another major source of NO<sub>2</sub> emission.

</figure>

<p style="text-align:justify;">
In case of Major roads, we clearly see with the increasing length of major roads, there is clear increase in the concentration of NO<sub>2</sub> (Figure 3). Moreover, visually, it looks like there is a steep increase in the concentration of NO<sub>2</sub> initially with the increase of major roads, but the rate of increase slows down as the length of major roads increases further. The reason of such increase is understandable since the production of NO<sub>2</sub> is directly influenced by the volume of traffic and high traffic areas will release more NO<sub>2</sub> as the more diesel vehicles will be on the road contributing to high NO<sub>2</sub> emissions. Similar trend is observed for the relationship between NO<sub>2</sub> concentration and residential roads and total roads (Figure 4-5).

In case of population, it looked like an exponential curve which might describe the pattern very well where initially with the increase in population there is a drastic increase in NO<sub>2</sub> concentration which saturates at a certain point (Figure 6).

</figure>

<p style="text-align:justify;">
Figure 7 shows the relationship between NO<sub>2</sub> concentration and the distance from the coast. In general, as the distance from the coast will be less, there should be lower concentration of NO<sub>2</sub> due to the ventilation from the winds. However, in the figure we can clearly see higher concentration of NO<sub>2</sub> in some of the places which are closest to coast. It indicates that although coastal distance have effect on NO<sub>2</sub> but it should be analyzed in combination with other land use pattern because even if the place is closer to coast but if there is high population density and roads, it will have higher NO<sub>2</sub>. 
Overall, all of these land-use characteristics have their own effect on the NO<sub>2</sub> concentration and in some cases, there is strong relationship with NO<sub>2</sub>.

</figure>

<p style="text-align:justify;">
As a next step, we also investigated the scenario of NO<sub>2</sub> concentration at individual state level and for the preliminary analysis we selected four states- IL, CA, FL and ND. The reason of selecting these four states was to capture the diverse representation of factors that might influence the NO<sub>2</sub> level which might be helpful for generalizing our analysis in future. CA is a highly urbanized and densely populated state with around 94 station available at the given dataset which is the reason we considered CA for our analysis. IL offers a perspective in the NO<sub>2</sub> pattern of Midwestâ€™s urban and suburban areas whereas FL is a coastal state which might help to understand the effect of breeze and humidity on NO<sub>2</sub>. Lastly, ND is a low-population and rural environment with minimal urbanization which might help us to understand the effect of such characteristics on NO<sub>2</sub>. The effect of the land use characteristics described earlier on NO<sub>2</sub> concentrations are summarized in Figure 8-15. Figure 16 presents the distribution of NO<sub>2</sub> pollutants of these states by monitoring station.
</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">
For CA state, visually we can clearly see there exists a correlation among impervious surface, population, length of the roads and NO2 concentration (Figure 8-9). Interesting to see, although some of the places are very closer to the coast but it has significant concentration of NO<sub>2</sub>. As discussed earlier, although the coastal distance is lower but other factors such as impervious area, population and length of the roads are so high that it affects the NO<sub>2</sub> significantly compared to the coastal distance from measuring station.

</figure>

<p style="text-align:justify;">
For IL state, there were only 6 stations, and the results suggests that there is a good relationship between impervious surface and NO<sub>2</sub> concentrations (Figure 10-11) . Also, since IL is far away from the coast it is clearly seen that NO<sub>2</sub> concentration has kind of linear relationship with coastal distance. Population and residential roads donâ€™t reveal any clear pattern but with the major roads, it is clearly visible that increase in the length of major roads correlates well with the increase in NO<sub>2</sub> concentrations. 
</p>

</figure>

<p style="text-align:justify;">
For FL state, impervious surface, population, roads all these parameters have kind of steady linear relationship with NO2 concentration and with the increase in these parameters NO<sub>2</sub> increase is not that significant (Figure 12-13). For example, in IL state, some of the places with 70-80% impervious area has around 30 ppb NO<sub>2</sub> concentration whereas in FL, places with 60-80% impervious area has around 12 ppb NO<sub>2</sub>. One of the major reason of this observed lower values could be due to the fact that all the stations in FL area are very close to the coast showing the noticeable effect of it on NO<sub>2</sub>.

</figure>

<p style="text-align:justify;">
In case of ND state, although it is very far from the coast but still it has very low concentration of NO<sub>2</sub> (highest being ~6%) (Figure 14-15). It could be attributed to the fact that all the stations had very low population and the length of the roads are the lowest among all the four states considered in the preliminary analysis. Overall, it is seen that out of all the land use characteristic considered, all of the factors do not have similar effect on NO2 concentration, and the effect varies from state to state.

__Plan for Predictive Modeling__ 
<p style="text-align:justify;">
Based on the preliminary analysis of our dataset, it is evident that all these land-use parameters, such as impervious surfaces, road density, population distribution, etc. play a crucial role in shaping NOâ‚‚ concentrations. These parameters exhibit a strong correlation with NOâ‚‚ levels, underscoring their significance as predictors. Our next objective is to quantify the specific effects of each land-use parameter on NOâ‚‚ concentration and identify which factors most significantly influence these levels. By pinpointing the primary contributors, we aim to refine our understanding of pollution sources and dispersion. 
</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">
Building on these findings, we will develop a predictive regression model capable of estimating NOâ‚‚ concentrations across different states in the U.S., factoring in the varying land-use patterns with high accuracy. For developing this model, we will consider interaction terms such as population density x road, impervious surface x major roads etc to capture the combined effects of multiple variables. We will do further correlation analysis to identify strong predictors of NO<sub>2</sub> emissions. Using PCA, we will try to reduce dimensionality if there are many correlated features simplifying the model without losing the predictive capacity. Then, we will explore different machine learning algorithms to find out which one works better for our purpose, followed by model training and cross-validation. We will consider different performance metrics like R-square, Root mean squared error values etc. to evaluate the model accuracy. Eventually, we will apply the model to predict NO<sub>2</sub> levels in regions that do not have measured data on NO<sub>2</sub> but haveâ€¯land-use information.  
</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">
Such a model has the potential to be instrumental for multiple applications. By assessing long-term health impacts associated with chronic exposure to pollutants, it can provide insights into the risk of respiratory and cardiovascular conditions associated with NOâ‚‚. This type of analysis is invaluable to public health agencies tasked with identifying regions and populations at greater risk of pollutant-related diseases [5-6]. Moreover, predictive modeling of NOâ‚‚ concentrations can guide policymakers and city planners in designing urban environments with better air quality. By predicting pollutant dispersion, decision-makers can strategically zone residential areas, schools, and recreational spaces away from high pollution zones, thus enhancing community health and safety. Finally, our model will help highlight areas where pollution levels are worsening, providing actionable insights for immediate interventions. This capability will empower environmental agencies to prioritize regions for pollution control efforts, thus contributing to a healthier and more sustainable living environment for all residents.
