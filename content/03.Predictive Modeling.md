__Description and Characterization of Dataset__ 

<p style="text-align:justify;">

In the predictive modeling, machine learning was used to make a predictive model of the dataset. The sequence of this project was as follows: 1. Data selection and clearing 2. Machine learning - 2.1 Normalization and Regularizatioon, 2.2 Perform analysis 2.3 Check the validity. In conclusion, all machine learning techniques were compared in terms of accuracy, speed, and simplicity.

__Data selection and coordinate transform__

First, the data was sorted by using the correlation plot. Since there were numerous variables in the dataset, selective dependent variables introduced in the exploratory data analysis section were also used for the machine learning. This contains distance to coast, Impervious 100, Impervious 5000, Impervious 10000, Population 100, Population 5000, Population 10000, Major 100, Major 5000, Major 10000, Residential 100, Residential 5000, Residential 10000, Total 100, Total 5000, Total 10000.

The correlation comparison was segmented into five different groups at first, since to visually inspect, it was impossible to compare all. Also, depending on the naming (i.e. impervious), this process was expected to classify necessary data. Figure 1 shows the results of each correlation plot.

As per the correlation plots, it was assumed that as the color of the curves get darker. By comparing all, it was concluded that distance to coast, impervious 100, major 100, major 5000, resident 100, resident 5000, total 100, and total 5000 have less correlation. This was reanalyzed through correlation plotting as shown in figure 2 to be more accurate.

Finally, Distance to coast, Impervious 100, Major 100, Major 5000, Resident 100, and Resident 5000 were selected as dependent variables. The dataframe consists of 369 rows and 8 columns (including state information and independent variable - Observed NO2 ppb).

Figure 3 is training dataset and figure 4 is testing dataset. As more data are used in analysis, the training gets more accurate. Thus, all state information with pre-selected variables were used for training. After machine learning, each results were compared to the four states information and/or all states information.

__Machine learning__

Machine learning was performed in five different methods: linear regression, decision tree, k-means clustering, neural network, [].
