__Description and Characterization of Dataset__ 

<p style="text-align:justify;">

In the predictive modeling, machine learning was used to make a predictive model of the dataset. The sequence of this project was as follows: 1. Data selection and clearing 2. Machine learning - 2.1 Normalization and Regularizatioon, 2.2 Perform analysis 2.3 Check the validity. At the conclusion, all machine learning techniques were compared in terms of accuracy, speed, and simplicity.

__Data selection and coordinate transform__

First, the data was sorted by using the correlation plot. Since there were numerous variables in the dataset, selective dependent variables introducedd in the exploratory analysis was also used for machine learning. By comparing correlation in a small segmented group (impervious, population, major, residential, and total), the representative data in each dependent variables were decided. Based on that, correlation was twice more performed to finalize which dependent variables to use.
