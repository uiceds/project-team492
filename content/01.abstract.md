## Project Description {.page_break_before}

__Description of data set:__ 
<p style="text-align:justify;">
The dataset used for this project focused on modeling NO2 concentrations in different locations of the different states of US using a Land-Use Regression (LUR) approach [1]. The data was collected from U.S Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) regulatory monitoring stations between 2000 and 2010. This NO2 concentration measurement in different location is the dependent variable of the dataset.

<p style="text-align:justify;">
The dataset contained different Land-Use geographic variables which are considered as the independent variables. These variables include impervious surface area (%coverage), population density, road lengths(major, residential, total), elevation of the location, distance to coast etc. These variables were evaluated over 22 buffers ranging from 100 m to 10 km to capture the local and regional land use pattern.

The dataset is a CSV file that contains 370 rows and 134 column which can be accessed from this link: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1dCy4GJo4pk0tVJMhmtnC5ZF12hiWM91q/view [Accessed 10/15/2024]

__Proposal:__ 

The main goal of this project will be to develop a predictive model which will predict the NO2 concentration of any location of US from different land use variables given in the dataset. It would be very useful to predict the concentrations of NO2 in any given location which will help to identify locations which needs immediate preventive measures and taking necessary actions.
