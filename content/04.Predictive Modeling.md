## 4. Predictive Modeling {.page_break_before}
   
__4.1 Machine learning methods__ 
<p style="text-align:justify;">
In this study, various machine learning models were implemented to predict NO2 concentrations based on different land-use variables. The primary goal was to build a predictive model following different techniques, compare their performances, and understand their strengths and limitations. The process began with a linear regression model, providing a foundation for data analysis and serving as a benchmark for advanced models. This was followed by the implementation of decision tree regression, random forest regressor, and a neural network algorithm. The models were evaluated using metrics like R² and RMSE values. RMSE is a root mean square error, in which the best value is 0 and the worst value is near infinite [7]. R2 is the proportion of the variance in the dependent variable that is predictable from the independent variables [8]. R2 is best when close to 1 and worst in - infinite. Each machine learning method was compared with these criteria to show their effectiveness. This systematic comparison aims to provide insights into the suitability of different algorithms for NO2 modeling based on land use patterns.

__4.1.1. Linear regression__  
</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">
The first method used for machine learning was the linear regression model. Linear regression establishes a straight-line relationship between the independent variables (features) and the dependent variable (NO2 levels) by fitting the data to minimize the root mean squared error. The dataset is standardized to ensure that all features have a mean of zero and a standard deviation of one, which is critical for maintaining balance among variables with different scales. A total of 369 samples are divided into training and testing datasets using an 75/25 split. The code used for generating this linear regression model is shown in the appendix. The R2 value of the developed model was 0.49 and RMSE value was 4.3. Figure 4.1 shows the accuracy of the model by plotting predicted NO2 value against observed NO2 value for test and training dataset.

<p style="text-align:justify;">
__4.1.2. Decision tree regression__
</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">
A decision tree is a supervised machine learning algorithm used for regression tasks. It predicts the value of a target variable by recursively splitting the dataset based on decision rules derived from feature values. In regression tasks, the splits minimize a loss function, such as the mean squared error (MSE), to ensure that predictions at each leaf node are as close as possible to the actual values. Some critical parameters of this algorithm are:
</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">  
a) max_depth: It limits the minimum number of samples required to split an internal node. This study considers a depth of 20, which is suitable for capturing the complex land use patterns and correlation with NO2 data without overfitting.
</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">  
b) min_samples_split: It is the minimum number of samples required to split an internal node. The large values prevent overfitting by avoiding overly specific splits. A value of 2 was considered in the model.
</p>
   
</p><p style="text-align:justify;">  
c) min_samples_leaf: The minimum number of samples required to be at a leaf node ensures that leaf nodes represent significant data, improving model generalization. 
</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">  
Figure 4.2 shows the result from decision tree regression. Ahe model produced an R² value of -0.0 and an RMSE of 5.55, indicating poor predictive performance and a lack of generalization to unseen data. This suggests that a single decision tree is insufficient for capturing the complexity of the NO₂ dataset, as it is prone to overfitting and underperforming on test data.

__4.1.3. Random forest Regressor__
<p style="text-align:justify;">   
The random forest regressor is an ensemble machine learning method that improves prediction accuracy by combining multiple decision trees. Unlike a single decision tree, which is prone to overfitting, random forest aggregates predictions from a set of decision trees to reduce variance and improve generalization. Each tree is trained on a different bootstrapped subset of the data, and at each split, only a random subset of features is considered, making the model robust to noise and irrelevant variables. Key parameters used are: n_trees:200, max_depth: 20, min_samples_split: 15 and min_samples_leaf=10. The model is trained using the DecisionTree package. The accuracy was checked by R2 and RMSE values, which are 0.5 and 3.58, respectively. Figure 4.3 shows the relationship between trained NO2 values and observed NO2 values using Random Forest Regressor model. The procedure for coding is shown in the appendix.

__4.1.4 Neural Network Algorithm__
</p>
   
<p style="text-align:justify;">     
A neural network is a computational model inspired by the human brain, consisting of layers of interconnected neurons. It is commonly used to learn patterns and relationships in a dataset. This model has been applied to explore its predictive capability compared to other techniques. 
</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">  
The main neural network architecture has been defined using the chain structure, which takes 12 features as input and passes them to the first hidden layer. Three hidden layers have been added with 128, 64, and 32 neurons, along with ReLU activation. A dropout of 0.5 has been kept to drop 50% of the neurons randomly to prevent overfitting. A single neuron outputs the predicted NO2 value. For this predictive model, R2 value was 0.6 and RMSE value was 3.12. Figure 4.4 shows the relationship between trained NO2 values and observed NO2 values using neural network model. The procedure for coding is shown in the appendix.

__4.2 Comparison Among Different Predictive Models__
</p>


<p style="text-align:justify;">  
The analysis utilized four predictive modeling techniques to predict NO2 concentrations using a dataset of various land use patterns in different locations across the US. The evaluation metrics of all the predictive models used in the analysis are summarized in the table below. The accuracy of the predictive model is as follows: Neural Network model > Random Forest Regression > Linear Regression > Decision Tree Regression. Although the Decision Tree Regression modeling had the least accuracy, the value was still comparably low, which is also considered accurate. Random Forest model with an R2 value of 0.54 suggested a moderate predictive capability. These results highlight the importance of accounting for the non-linear interactions and feature complexities when modeling NO2 concentrations, with Neural Networks demonstrating their strength in capturing such patterns. Plenty of data was used for machine learning in the dataset. The algorithm could be more tuned to enhance the accuracy; currently, simple regression models are utilized without passing complex filters. Also, the methods could be combined, not only training with one method. Still, the R2 and RMSE values are showing promising results.
