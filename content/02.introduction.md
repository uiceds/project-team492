<p style="text-align:justify;">
Nitrogen dioxide (NO₂) is a significant air pollutant primarily produced through the combustion of fossil fuels in transportation, industrial activities, and commercial processes[1]. Recognized for its adverse health effects, including respiratory issues and contribution to atmospheric pollution, NO₂ has emerged as one of the most critical ambient air pollutants requiring attention [2]. Typically, urban areas exhibit higher concentrations of NO₂ compared to rural regions due to denser populations and increased anthropogenic activities.

<p style="text-align:justify;">
Understanding the environmental factors contributing to NO₂ levels is essential for developing effective strategies to control and reduce its presence in the atmosphere. Kulkarni et al., [3] developed an empirical model to predict indoor nitrogen dioxide (NO₂) concentrations based on outdoor measurements, emphasizing the influence of ventilation and indoor sources like cooking fuels. An empirical model was developed to predict indoor concentrations from outdoor near home concentrations for NO2. Meng et al., [4] developed Land Use Regression (LUR) models for NO2 concentrations for residential exposures using measurements conducted at 144 variable sites in the Netherlands. In another study, Kriging, Inverse distance method and LUR was used to estimate the NO2 concentrations in Shanghai, China where LUR outperformed the other methods [5]. The findings suggested that the LUR model can provide a cost-effective method of air pollution exposure assessment in a developing country.

Accurately predicting NO₂ concentrations can help identify areas that require immediate preventive measures, thereby aiding policymakers and environmental agencies in implementing targeted interventions. To achieve this goal, we have selected a dataset containing air pollution data from five states across different regions of the United States. The data were collected from the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) regulatory monitoring stations between 2000 and 2010 [6]. The dataset is in spreadsheet format and includes spatial and temporal NO₂ concentration measurements in parts per billion (ppb), along with Geographical Information Systems (GIS) data on land-use features. The dataset is based on land use pattern which can help predict the NO2 concentrations accurately if land use patterns of a place are known. Land use patterns refer to the physical characteristics of the land surface in a given area, including how the land is utilized by humans - such as residential areas, industrial zones and roads, and the use has been reported to directly affect NO2 concentration in the environment. 
</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">
The dataset attributes (columns) are as follows:
</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">
NO2_Concentration (ppb): The measured concentration of NO₂ at each monitoring station, with values ranging from 0.31 to 34.21 ppb across different states.
</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">
Impervious_100 (%): The percentage of impervious surfaces, such as roads and buildings, within a 100-meter buffer zone around the measuring station. This variable indicates the extent of urban development immediately surrounding the monitoring site.
</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">
Major_100 (meters): The total length of major roads within a 100 meters radius of the measuring location. Major roads are significant sources of NO₂ due to high traffic volumes and heavy-duty vehicle emissions.
</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">
Resident_100 (meters): The total length of residential roads within a 100 meters radius around the measuring station. 
</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">
Total_100 (meters): The combined length of all roads—including major, minor, and residential—within a 100-meter buffer zone around the measuring station.
</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">
Population_100 (people per square kilometer): The population density within the 100-meter buffer area around the measuring station. Higher population densities often correlate with increased vehicular traffic and energy consumption, leading to higher NO₂ emissions.
</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">
Elevation (meters above sea level): The elevation of the measuring station, which can influence atmospheric dispersion and concentration of pollutants due to changes in air pressure and temperature gradients.
</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">
Distance_to_coast (kilometers): The distance from the measuring station to the nearest coastline. Proximity to the coast can affect NO₂ levels due to maritime activities and meteorological conditions like sea breezes that influence pollutant dispersion.
</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">
By modeling NO2 concentrations using land-use variables, we can determine which land-use factors influence NO2 levels the most. The predicted model can also estimate NO2 concentration in areas without monitoring stations by applying the model to similar land-use characteristics. Lastly, this model can help us identify high-risk areas for public health interventions based on predicted NO2 levels.
