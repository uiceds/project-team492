## 2. Introduction {.page_break_before}

<p style="text-align:justify;">
Nitrogen dioxide (NO₂) is a significant air pollutant primarily produced through the combustion of fossil fuels in transportation, industrial activities, and commercial processes[1]. Recognized for its adverse health effects, including respiratory issues and contribution to atmospheric pollution, NO₂ has emerged as one of the most critical ambient air pollutants requiring attention [2]. Typically, urban areas exhibit higher concentrations of NO₂ compared to rural regions due to denser populations and increased anthropogenic activities.
</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">
Understanding the environmental factors contributing to NO₂ levels is essential for developing effective strategies to control and reduce its presence in the atmosphere. Kulkarni et al., [3] developed an empirical model to predict indoor nitrogen dioxide (NO₂) concentrations based on outdoor measurements, emphasizing the influence of ventilation and indoor sources like cooking fuels. An empirical model was developed to predict indoor concentrations from outdoor near home concentrations for NO2. Meng et al., [4] developed Land Use Regression (LUR) models for NO2 concentrations for residential exposures using measurements conducted at 144 variable sites in the Netherlands. In another study, Kriging, Inverse distance method and LUR was used to estimate the NO2 concentrations in Shanghai, China where LUR outperformed the other methods [5]. The findings suggested that the LUR model can provide a cost-effective method of air pollution exposure assessment in a developing country. 
</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">
Accurately predicting NO₂ concentrations can help identify areas that require immediate preventive measures, thereby aiding policymakers and environmental agencies in implementing targeted interventions. To achieve this goal, we have selected a dataset containing air pollution data from five states across different regions of the United States. The data were collected from the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) regulatory monitoring stations between 2000 and 2010 [6]. The dataset is in spreadsheet format and includes spatial and temporal NO₂ concentration measurements in parts per billion (ppb), along with Geographical Information Systems (GIS) data on land-use features. The dataset is based on land use pattern which can help predict the NO2 concentrations accurately if land use patterns of a place are known. Land use patterns refer to the physical characteristics of the land surface in a given area, including how the land is utilized by humans - such as residential areas, industrial zones and roads, and the use has been reported to directly affect NO2 concentration in the environment. 
</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">
The dataset attributes (columns) are as follows:
</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">
NO₂_Concentration (ppb): The measured concentration of NO₂ at each monitoring station, with values ranging from 0.31 to 34.21 ppb across different states.
</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">
Impervious_100 (%): The percentage of impervious surfaces, such as roads and buildings, within a 100-meter buffer zone around the measuring station. This variable indicates the extent of urban development immediately surrounding the monitoring site.
</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">
Major_100 (meters): The total length of major roads within a 100 meters radius of the measuring location. Major roads are significant sources of NO₂ due to high traffic volumes and heavy-duty vehicle emissions.
</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">
Resident_100 (meters): The total length of residential roads within a 100 meters radius around the measuring station. 
</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">
Total_100 (meters): The combined length of all roads—including major, minor, and residential—within a 100-meter buffer zone around the measuring station.
</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">
Population_100 (people per square kilometer): The population density within the 100-meter buffer area around the measuring station. Higher population densities often correlate with increased vehicular traffic and energy consumption, leading to higher NO₂ emissions.
</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">
Elevation (meters): The elevation of the measuring station, which can influence atmospheric dispersion and concentration of pollutants due to changes in air pressure and temperature gradients.
</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">
Distance_to_coast (kilometers): The distance from the measuring station to the nearest coastline. Proximity to the coast can affect NO₂ levels due to maritime activities and meteorological conditions like sea breezes that influence pollutant dispersion.
</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">
By modeling NO₂ concentrations using land-use variables, we can determine which land-use factors influence NO₂ levels the most. The predicted model can also estimate NO₂ concentration in areas without monitoring stations by applying the model to similar land-use characteristics. Lastly, this model can help us identify high-risk areas for public health interventions based on predicted NO2 levels.
</p>


## 3. Exploratory Data Analysis {.page_break_before}
   
__3.1 Preliminary Analysis and Plots__ 
<p style="text-align:justify;">
To understand our selected dataset, we did some preliminary analysis to visualize the dataset which enabled us to learn some of the patterns of different land use features with NO2 concentration. First, we tried find out if there is any direct relationship between any of the land use characteristics and NO2 concentrations measured at the monitor station. For this preliminary analysis, we considered the effect of this land use pattern within 100m, 5000m and 10000m radius of the station. The reason for selecting these three radii was to cover short, medium and long-distance land use behavior around the station. Figure 3.1-3.5 presents the effect of different land-use characteristics on the NO2 concentration. 
</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">
For impervious surfaces, for all three cases, we can clearly see there is a trend that with the increase of impervious surfaces around the station, the concentration of NO2 increases gradually (Figure 3.1). As the impervious surface increases, it indicates there is increase in roads, sidewalks, parking lots, buildings, traffic and also there is decrease in vegetation areas and soil surface. Therefore, all these impervious surfaces are kind of indicator of high volume of vehicles, high population density which contributes to high NO2 emission and also the absence of natural filtration effect with the absence of vegetation is another major source of NO2 emission.
</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">
In case of Major roads, we clearly see with the increasing length of major roads, there is clear increase in the concentration of NO2 (Figure 3.2). Moreover, visually, it looks like there is a steep increase in the concentration of NO2 initially with the increase of major roads, but the rate of increase slows down as the length of major roads increases further. The reason for such an increase is understandable since the production of NO2 is directly influenced by the volume of traffic, and high-traffic areas will release more NO2 as more diesel vehicles will be on the road, contributing to high NO2 emissions. 
</p>

</figure>

<p style="text-align:justify;">
Similar trend is observed for the relationship between NO2 concentration and residential roads and total roads (Figure 3.3-3.4). In case of population, it looked like an exponential curve which might describe the pattern very well where initially with the increase in population there is a drastic increase in NO2 concentration which saturates at a certain point (Figure 3.5). Figure 3.6 shows the relationship between NO2 concentration and the distance from the coast. In general, as the distance from the coast will be less, there should be lower concentration of NO2 due to the ventilation from the winds. However, in the figure we can clearly see higher concentration of NO2 in some of the places which are closest to coast. It indicates that although coastal distance have effect on NO2 but it should be analyzed in combination with other land use pattern because even if the place is closer to coast but if there is high population density and roads, it will have higher NO2. 
Overall, all of these land-use characteristics have their own effect on the NO2 concentration and in some cases, there is strong relationship with NO2.

</figure>

<p style="text-align:justify;">
As a next step, we also investigated the scenario of NO<sub>2</sub> concentration at individual state level and for the preliminary analysis we selected two states- IL, CA, FL and ND. The reason of selecting these four states was to capture the diverse representation of factors that might influence the NO<sub>2</sub> level which might be helpful for generalizing our analysis in future. CA is a highly urbanized and densely populated state with around 94 station available at the given dataset which is the reason we considered CA for our analysis. IL offers a perspective in the NO<sub>2</sub> pattern of Midwest’s urban and suburban areas whereas FL is a coastal state which might help to understand the effect of breeze and humidity on NO<sub>2</sub>. Lastly, ND is a low-population and rural environment with minimal urbanization which might help us to understand the effect of such characteristics on NO<sub>2</sub>. The effect of the land use characteristics described earlier on NO<sub>2</sub> concentrations are summarized in Figure 3.7-3.10.   
</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">
For CA state, visually we can clearly see there exists a correlation among impervious surface, population, length of the roads and NO2 concentration (Figure 3.7). Interesting to see, although some of the places are very closer to the coast but it has significant concentration of NO<sub>2</sub>. As discussed earlier, although the coastal distance is lower but other factors such as impervious area, population and length of the roads are so high that it affects the NO<sub>2</sub> significantly compared to the coastal distance from measuring station. 
</p>

<figure style="text-align: center;">

    <figcaption><strong>Figure 3.7:</strong> Effect of different land use characteristics on NO<sub>2</sub> concentration of CA state.</figcaption>
</figure>

<p style="text-align:justify;">
For IL state, there were only 6 stations, and the results suggests that there is a good relationship between impervious surface and NO<sub>2</sub> concentrations (Figure 3.8) . Also, since IL is far away from the coast it is clearly seen that NO<sub>2</sub> concentration has kind of linear relationship with coastal distance. Population and residential roads don’t reveal any clear pattern but with the major roads, it is clearly visible that increase in the length of major roads correlates well with the increase in NO<sub>2</sub> concentrations. 
</p>

<figure style="text-align: center;">
    <img src="https://github.com/uiceds/project-team492/blob/main/content/images/Figure%2010.PNG?raw=true" alt="Sample Image">
    <figcaption><strong>Figure 3.8:</strong> Effect of different land use characteristics on NO<sub>2</sub> concentration of IL state.</figcaption>
</figure>

<p style="text-align:justify;">
For FL state, impervious surface, population, roads all these parameters have kind of steady linear relationship with NO2 concentration and with the increase in these parameters NO<sub>2</sub> increase is not that significant (Figure 3.9). For example, in IL state, some of the places with 70-80% impervious area has around 30 ppb NO<sub>2</sub> concentration whereas in FL, places with 60-80% impervious area has around 12 ppb NO<sub>2</sub>. One of the major reason of this observed lower values could be due to the fact that all the stations in FL area are very close to the coast showing the noticeable effect of it on NO<sub>2</sub>.
</p>

    <figcaption><strong>Figure 3.9:</strong> Effect of different land use characteristics on NO<sub>2</sub> concentration of FL state. </figcaption>
</figure>

<p style="text-align:justify;">
In case of ND state, although it is very far from the coast but still it has very low concentration of NO<sub>2</sub> (highest being ~6%) (Figure 3.10). It could be attributed to the fact that all the stations had very low population and the length of the roads are the lowest among all the four states considered in the preliminary analysis. Overall, it is seen that out of all the land use characteristic considered, all of the factors do not have similar effect on NO2 concentration, and the effect varies from state to state.

__3.2 Data selection and Feature Engineering__
<p style="text-align:justify;">
Based on the above plots, although we can see some correlation between few parameters but it is difficult to select the important feature to be considered for predictive modelling. Therefore, as a next step we tried correlation plots and Lasso regularization to find out the most relevant parameters for predictive modelling. Since there were numerous variables in the dataset, initially selective dependent variables at 100, 5000 and 1000m considered. Typical correlation plot of impervious_100, impervious_5000 and impervious_10000 are shown in Figure 3.11. Similarly, we explored all other variables and analyzed their correlation plots and finally selected the most important features based on this analysis for predictive modelling. The correlation plot of some of the final selected features are shown in Figure 3.12 and it is clear that these features exhibited lower inter correlations among themselves.
</p>
<figure style="text-align: center;">
    <img src="https://github.com/uiceds/project-team492/blob/main/content/images/Cor_I_TEE.png?raw=true">
    <figcaption><strong>Figure 3.11:</strong>  Correlation plot showing the effect of independent variables such as distance_to_coast, Imp_100, Imp_5000 and Imp_10000.  </figcaption>

    <figcaption><strong>Figure 3.12:</strong>  Correlation plot showing the effect of few selected independent variables for final predictive modeling  </figcaption>
</figure>
<p style="text-align:justify;">
To aid this feature selection process with correlation plot, Lasso Regression (Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator) was applied to the dataset for selecting the most relevant features to predict observed NO2 concentrations. The main advantage of Lasso regression is that it reduces complexity by shrinking less important feature coefficient to zero. The reason of selecting Lasso was as it performs both feature selection and regularization, simplifying the model by irrelevant and redundant features. Lasso Regression along with cross-validation was applied that performs k-fold cross-validation (which is by default 10) to find the optimal regularization parameter, lambda. Alpha value of 1.0 specifies exactly Lasso regularization rather than Ridge or elastic net. Thereafter, using the best lambda value, a new Lasso model was fit which enable the model to learn the optimal coefficient for selected features. Finally, coefficient of features was evaluated and non-zero coefficients were calculated by Lasso for using the selected features for further modelling. (Table 3.1). It is seen that along with the features selected from correlation plot, Lasso regularization suggested few other independent variables which were also considered for modelling. To develop predictive model, for training and test data distribution, 75/25 ratio was followed where 75% of data points were considered training data and rest of the data points were test data.

__3.3 Plan for Predictive Modeling__ 
<p style="text-align:justify;">
Based on the preliminary analysis of our dataset, it is evident that all these land-use parameters, such as impervious surfaces, road density, population distribution, etc. play a crucial role in shaping NO₂ concentrations. These parameters exhibit a strong correlation with NO₂ levels, underscoring their significance as predictors. Building on these findings, we will develop a predictive regression model capable of estimating NO₂ concentrations across different states in the U.S., factoring in the varying land-use patterns with high accuracy. For developing this model, we will consider the independent variables as selected above from Lasso Regularization and correlation plots. Eventually, we will apply the model to predict NO<sub>2</sub> levels in regions that do not have measured data on NO<sub>2</sub> but have land-use information.  
</p>


   
  


## 4. Predictive Modeling {.page_break_before}
   
__4.1 Machine learning methods__ 
<p style="text-align:justify;">
In this study, various machine learning models were implemented to predict NO2 concentrations based on different land-use variables. The primary goal was to build a predictive model following different techniques, compare their performances, and understand their strengths and limitations. The process began with a linear regression model, providing a foundation for data analysis and serving as a benchmark for advanced models. This was followed by the implementation of decision tree regression, random forest regressor, and a neural network algorithm. The models were evaluated using metrics like R² and RMSE values. RMSE is a root mean square error, in which the best value is 0 and the worst value is near infinite [7]. R2 is the proportion of the variance in the dependent variable that is predictable from the independent variables [8]. R2 is best when close to 1 and worst in - infinite. Each machine learning method was compared with these criteria to show their effectiveness. This systematic comparison aims to provide insights into the suitability of different algorithms for NO2 modeling based on land use patterns.

__4.1.1. Linear regression__  
</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">
The first method used for machine learning was the linear regression model. Linear regression establishes a straight-line relationship between the independent variables (features) and the dependent variable (NO2 levels) by fitting the data to minimize the root mean squared error. The dataset is standardized to ensure that all features have a mean of zero and a standard deviation of one, which is critical for maintaining balance among variables with different scales. A total of 369 samples are divided into training and testing datasets using an 75/25 split. The code used for generating this linear regression model is shown in the appendix. The R2 value of the developed model was 0.49 and RMSE value was 4.3. Figure 4.1 shows the accuracy of the model by plotting predicted NO2 value against observed NO2 value for test and training dataset.

__4.1.2. Decision tree regression__
</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">
A decision tree is a supervised machine learning algorithm used for regression tasks. It predicts the value of a target variable by recursively splitting the dataset based on decision rules derived from feature values. In regression tasks, the splits minimize a loss function, such as the mean squared error (MSE), to ensure that predictions at each leaf node are as close as possible to the actual values. Some critical parameters of this algorithm are:
</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">  
a) max_depth: It limits the minimum number of samples required to split an internal node. This study considers a depth of 20, which is suitable for capturing the complex land use patterns and correlation with NO2 data without overfitting.
</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">  
b) min_samples_split: It is the minimum number of samples required to split an internal node. The large values prevent overfitting by avoiding overly specific splits. A value of 2 was considered in the model.
</p>
   
</p><p style="text-align:justify;">  
c) min_samples_leaf: The minimum number of samples required to be at a leaf node ensures that leaf nodes represent significant data, improving model generalization. 
</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">  
Figure 4.2 shows the result from decision tree regression. Ahe model produced an R² value of -0.0 and an RMSE of 5.55, indicating poor predictive performance and a lack of generalization to unseen data. This suggests that a single decision tree is insufficient for capturing the complexity of the NO₂ dataset, as it is prone to overfitting and underperforming on test data.

__4.1.3. Random forest Regressor__
<p style="text-align:justify;">   
The random forest regressor is an ensemble machine learning method that improves prediction accuracy by combining multiple decision trees. Unlike a single decision tree, which is prone to overfitting, random forest aggregates predictions from a set of decision trees to reduce variance and improve generalization. Each tree is trained on a different bootstrapped subset of the data, and at each split, only a random subset of features is considered, making the model robust to noise and irrelevant variables. Key parameters used are: n_trees:200, max_depth: 20, min_samples_split: 15 and min_samples_leaf=10. The model is trained using the DecisionTree package. The accuracy was checked by R2 and RMSE values, which are 0.5 and 3.58, respectively. Figure 4.3 shows the relationship between trained NO2 values and observed NO2 values using Random Forest Regressor model. The procedure for coding is shown in the appendix.

__4.1.4 Neural Network Algorithm__
</p>
   
<p style="text-align:justify;">     
A neural network is a computational model inspired by the human brain, consisting of layers of interconnected neurons. It is commonly used to learn patterns and relationships in a dataset. This model has been applied to explore its predictive capability compared to other techniques. 
</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">  
The main neural network architecture has been defined using the chain structure, which takes 12 features as input and passes them to the first hidden layer. Three hidden layers have been added with 128, 64, and 32 neurons, along with ReLU activation. A dropout of 0.5 has been kept to drop 50% of the neurons randomly to prevent overfitting. A single neuron outputs the predicted NO2 value. For this predictive model, R2 value was 0.6 and RMSE value was 3.12. Figure 4.4 shows the relationship between trained NO2 values and observed NO2 values using neural network model. The procedure for coding is shown in the appendix.

__4.2 Comparison Among Different Predictive Models__
</p>


<p style="text-align:justify;">  
The analysis utilized four predictive modeling techniques to predict NO2 concentrations using a dataset of various land use patterns in different locations across the US. The evaluation metrics of all the predictive models used in the analysis are summarized in the table below. The accuracy of the predictive model is as follows: Neural Network model > Random Forest Regression > Linear Regression > Decision Tree Regression. Although the Decision Tree Regression modeling had the least accuracy, the value was still comparably low, which is also considered accurate. Random Forest model with an R2 value of 0.54 suggested a moderate predictive capability. These results highlight the importance of accounting for the non-linear interactions and feature complexities when modeling NO2 concentrations, with Neural Networks demonstrating their strength in capturing such patterns. Plenty of data was used for machine learning in the dataset. The algorithm could be more tuned to enhance the accuracy; currently, simple regression models are utilized without passing complex filters. Also, the methods could be combined, not only training with one method. Still, the R2 and RMSE values are showing promising results.
